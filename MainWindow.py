    Moreover, if there aren't any binaries in there (or the binaries
    have had their names changed) there won't be a way to, say, start
    the server, or do something like run the game itself.  We should
    check to see if there are the appropriate binaries at some point
    and fail somehow if they don't exist (or maybe ask if they simply
    want to have this directory act as a mod cache if they're partitioning
    things?)

    This could (should) all go on the github issue tracker at some point.

    However!  For now, we're going to simply treat the folder supplied as
    a mod cache.  We're going to be a complete jerk to the user and
    assume that they just want to install mods to any random directory.
    Later, however, we should add in some more functionality to see if 
    this is, indeed, a proper arma 2 installation.
