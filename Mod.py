  A mod is a high level representation of a
  module for Arma 2.  A mod contains a path.  From
  there it finds out its version and its dependencies
  so long as the path exists.

  Because of the current implementation, a mod is not
  valid unless it contains some form of version data, so
  an empty folder will not suffice for a valid mod.

  A mod is capable of verifying itself based on the mod
  format (the implementation of which may change later).
