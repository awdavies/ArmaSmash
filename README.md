Arma 2 Mod Installer/Updater.

##Requirements

* Nose
* wxPython
* Python 2.7
* Rsync

##Current State
Right now the files don't do much of anything other than scrape through the default directory to determine if there are any valid mods lying around.  It does not check the mods' data, and isn't yet capable of getting all of the mods' checksums.

The next steps will be to verify the contents of the mod (using the yaml method that the current SIX guys use), and to update them.  Everything else will be built up from there.
